This project investigated the impact of selective damage to low spontaneous rate auditory nerve fibers in the development of an AN population output characteristic of tinnitus in individuals with normal audiograms, which is theorized to be the result of a maladaptive plasticity.  An auditory nerve model was identified that allowed selective damage to low SR fibers, its output was used to generate a population response of fibers evenly spaced at the center frequencies of a 1/3 octave frequency band, and the effects of selective deafferentiation was quantified.  Individual fiber responses were shown to be significantly different between damage conditions, with varied effect as a function of spontaneous rate.  This result is consistent with other current work.
